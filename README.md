fs.js
=====

This module provides a wrapper for the HTML5 File System API inspired in nodejs fs module.
While the underlying HTML5 API is quite feature rich, it is low level and difficult to use.

fs.js provides a good tradeoff between easy to use and flexibility with a cleaner api.

Note that this module is *inspired* by node js, not a port, and will therefore not be 
totally compatible with it. Also the module provides some useful methods that only
make sense on a browser environment (such as getting the url pointing to a local file).


Install
=======

Just pick up fs.js and include it in a script tag or use it with an AMD compatible loader. 
If you want to run the unit tests you can install the module via npm:

        npm install fs.js
        

Unit tests
==========

The unit tests are writte using mocha. For running the unit tests you need to use node and a webbrowser
with File System API capabilities (only Chrome at the moment).

Go to the test directory and run the test server:

        node server.js
        
Open a webbrowser pointing to http://localhost:8080


Quick Start
===========

Start by creating a file system. Note that we support a prefix for every file system.
This prefix allows us to have several independent file systems:

        var sizeInBytes = 1024 * 1024,
          prefix = 'filetest';
  
        FSFactory.create(sizeInBytes, 'test_fs', function(err, fs) {
          fs.read('foo', function(err, data){
            // data contains file contents.
          });
        });


Check the methods section for all the methods provided by the file system object.
